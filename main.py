poetry run python -m app.data_pipeline.main

Did: Remove logging
Idea: Type hinting by giving example

Double source of truth
:::::: TODO :::::::::::::::
0. Move main out of data_producer
1. Split code up now. Different files
2. Split up initializing exchanges
3. Logging
4. Setup the basic flask front end, to make sure it can interface with
5. Add other streams like open interest
6. Clean up imports and unused code
7. Optimize redis and figure out thread, conn pooling, cluster, async etc
   the way i have implemented redis storage.
- GO through redis datatypes throughly and
  learn more before hodepodging stuff together
- Ask first what traders ned
- Priority queue for first order data
- create standalone function that verifys a config
  then just loop through it. This allows me to add more
  exchanges and symbols on the fly later.
- Breakup initialize exchanges
- Second data consumer that writes to archival
  . Does not go through redis
- Break try catch running streams into own function
- Check how i injected meta data like exchange and symbol
on the other one, as some streams dont have that but i need it
- Implement exchange / ticker etc to check archival storage
